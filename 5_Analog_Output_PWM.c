AIM: To decrease the brightness of Red Led and simultaneously increase the brightness of Green Led,
	 then to decrease the brightness of Green Led and simultaneously increase the brightness of Blue Led,
	 then to decrease the brightness of Blue Led and simultaneously increase the brightness of Red Led
	 and repeat this cyclically.
